Scenario: Malformed Multiline Step - No leading step

----------
May we go our separate ways,
Finding fortune and new friends.
But let us not forget these days,
Or let the good times ever end.

A poet with wiser words than mine,
Wrote that nothing gold can stay.
These are golden days we're in,
And so are bound to fade away.
